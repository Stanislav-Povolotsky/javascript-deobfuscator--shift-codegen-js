Shift Code Generator
====================

## About

This module provides a code generator for [Shift format](https://github.com/shapesecurity/shift-spec) ASTs.

## Status

[Stable](http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index).


## Installation

```sh
npm install sp-shift-codegen
```


## Usage

```js
import codegen from "sp-shift-codegen";
let programSource = codegen(/* Shift format AST */);
```

Location information is available in environments which support WeakMap via an alternative interface:
```js
let tree = parseScript('foo(); bar;');

import { codeGenWithLocation } from "sp-shift-codegen";
let { source, locations } = codeGenWithLocation(tree);
source; // 'foo();bar';
locations.get(tree.statements[0].expression); // { start: { line: 1, column: 0, offset: 0 }, end: { line: 1, column: 5, offset: 5 } }
```
